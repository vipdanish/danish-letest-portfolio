# My Portfolio Website 🖥️

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, certifications, and achievements in **DevOps, Cloud, and Software Engineering**.
It serves as a central place where recruiters, collaborators, and peers can learn more about my work.

⚡ **Unique Theme**:

* Inspired by a **DevOps workflow**
* Starts with a **terminal simulation** (`git clone`, `build`, `test`, `publish`)
* Navigates through sections in a **Jenkins-style pipeline view** (Stage 1: About, Stage 2: Projects, etc.)
